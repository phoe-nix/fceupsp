FCEU-PSP is an attempt to port FCEUltra, a great Nintendo Entertainment System
emulator, for PSP. This is the first project of a "newbie" in the PSP
programming world, so there will be always something to be improved ;)

FCEU-PSP is opensource and you can help me to make it better. If you wish so,
please, get in touch by sending me an email.

You can always check for updates from: http://code.google.com/p/fceupsp/ or
