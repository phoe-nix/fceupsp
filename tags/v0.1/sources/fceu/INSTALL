To compile and install FCE Ultra, follow these steps:

	1.  Run "./configure".  If you want OpenGL support(which you probably do), and you
	    have the OpenGL headers installed, run configure with "--with-opengl".
	    To see all possible compilation options, run "./configure --help".

	    If you're compiling under Mac OS X, you should probably run configure
	    with "--disable-sdltest".

	    If you are compiling for MS Windows, and you want a GUI, try something like:

		./configure --with-nativewin32
		windres -o src/res.o src/drivers/win/res.res
		make

	    The "windres" command is necessary because I can't get automake to recognize
	    the resource object correctly.

	2.  Optionally, run "make install".  This is not well-tested, so it may do
	    EVIL THINGS.
