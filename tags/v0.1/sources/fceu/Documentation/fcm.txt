FCE Ultra Movie File Format
	- Updated March 22, 2004

The FCM file format is a somewhat "joined" file format.  The first part of a FCM
file will contain an FCS-format state save.  After this data, the FCM-specific data
begins, which is being referred to from this point.


Currently, the only supported input scheme for a FCM is four joysticks.

The FCM data consists of a stream of joystick commands:

	dLLjjbbb

	 d  = Dummy update, if set.  Used to reset frame timestamp.
	LL  = timestamp length, in bytes(maximum of 3 bytes).
	jj  = Which joystick(0-3).
        bbb = Which button(0-7).

	If the dummy update bit is set, a command can also have occurred.  Look at the
	lower 5 bits:
		0	=	Just a dummy update.
		1	=	Reset
		2	=	Power

	The timestamp is stored after the joystick command, in LSB-first format.  It is
	the number of frames since the last event.  A timestamp length of "0" is valid, to
	be used when several different buttons need to change state at the same time(same frame,
	at least).
